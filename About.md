The CF-MS explorer is a project of the [Foster laboratory](https://fosterlab.msl.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. 

This interactive web application allows users to explore co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) profiles of a protein or proteins of interest in a resource of 206 uniformly re-processed CF-MS experiments.

The data underlying this resource is available for download at several levels of analysis.  Raw MaxQuant outputs can be downloaded from [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD022048) (accession: PXD022048). 
Processed protein chromatograms, such as those plotted here, can be downloaded from  [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4106578) (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4106578).
Finally, data for a subset of proteins of interest can be downloaded directly from the web application.
