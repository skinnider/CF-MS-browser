The CF-MS explorer is a project of the [Foster laboratory](https://fosterlab.msl.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. 

This interactive web application allows users to explore co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CF-MS) profiles of a protein or proteins of interest in a resource of 206 uniformly re-processed CF-MS experiments. Users can specify up to 10 proteins at once. A wide variety of identifiers are supported, including gene symbols as well as UniProt, RefSeq, Ensembl, or EMBL identifiers, and eggNOG ortholog groups (OGs) at multiple different phylogenetic levels. 

The data underlying this resource is available for download at several levels of analysis.  Raw MaxQuant outputs can be downloaded from <link>. 
Processed protein chromatograms, such as those plotted here, can be downloaded from <link>. 
Finally, data for a subset of proteins of interest can be downloaded directly from the web application.
